## Hi there 👋
We are obed.<br>
We do cool stuff, maybe.<br>
Though our cool stuff ain't here yet.<br>
<br>
<br>
**Here are some ideas to get you started:**<br>
<br>
🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?<br>
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?<br>
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?<br>
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?<br>
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)<br>
